/* 

1. Define the Vehicle Class:

- The constructor should include properties: type, make, model, year,
and mileage.

- Use default values for mileage (e.g., 0).

2. Add Methods:

- drive(distance): Increases the vehicle’s mileage by the given
distance (in kilometers or miles).

- getDetails(): Returns a formatted string describing the vehicle’s
details.

3. Create and Use Vehicle Objects:

- Instantiate at least three vehicle objects with different properties (e.g.,
a car, a truck, and a motorcycle).

- Use the drive method to simulate trips and update mileage.

- Use the getDetails method to print each vehicle’s updated
information.
